			<div class="subtitle">
				<p>HOW I HELPED A NEW YOGA TEACHER GROW HER BUSINESS</p>
			</div>
			<div class="information">
				<p>Kerry Duma is a yoga teacher in Southeastern Wisconsin who recently decided to take her teaching to the next level. She wanted a simple website that would increase her credibility among potential clients and other yoga professionals. Since most of her students are in middle age or older, she wanted a website that was clean, easy to navigate, and sensible for the older viewer. She had a clear vision of what she wanted and I worked with her to make the idea in her head a reality. Since the launch of her website in early 2016, Kerry has seen an increase in students registering for her classes and reaching out for private lessons. Next steps for this website include applying my UX skills to do a site redesign.</p>

				<p>BRIAN MOOG: PERSONAL CHEF & EVENT MANAGEMENT</p>
			</div>
			<div class="subtitle">
				<p>HOW A CHEF GREW HIS BRAND</p>
			</div>
			<div class="information">
				<p>Brian Moog is a talented chef who cooks for events ranging from a small private dinner to big parties of hundreds of people. He wanted a website that would expand his brand and lead new clients his way. It had to be food-focused and match the beautiful aesthetic of his food and presentation. He wanted a site that conveyed his expertise in both food and event management that gave the user a clear hold on the types services he offers. I coded his website by hand without the use of a template and handled the purchasing of his domain and hosting for him. I continue to work with Brian on gathering the final pieces of the site, including photos and testimonials.</p>
