				<p>URBAN LEASH</p>

			<div class="subtitle">
				<p>A LOCAL DOG WALKING START-UP GETS UX SAVVY</p>
			</div>
			<div class="information">
				<p>Urban Leash is a Chicago start-up that provides on-demand dog walking and cat sitting, and was paired up with my team for our capstone project in GA's UX Design Immersive. I worked with three teammates to conduct rigorous research and took on the challenge of redesigning the app's registration and booking process. Through research and multiple rounds of iteration, I created a solution that elimated the most frequent customer pain points and built much-needed trust between the company and customer.</p>

				<p>MOMENTS: THE LAST PHOTO-TAKING APP YOU'LL EVER NEED</p>
			</div>
			<div class="subtitle">
				<p>WHAT I DESIGNED FOR THE PHOTO-OBSESSED AND EVERYONE ELSE</p>
			</div>
			<div class="information">
				<p>We all know people who insist on inconvenient photo-taking that disrupts our moments. Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to have beautiful pictures of ourselves with the ones we love that didn't interrupt our time together? Moments is my solution. This app is designed to photograph people in a hands-free, automatic way, allowing people to set their phone down and pick it up later to view dozens of unposed, organic photos of their friends and family. Added features like inviting collaborators directly to the photos and sending the cream of the crop to a variety of digital "Frames" around your virtual world make Moments the last photo-taking app you'll ever need.</p>

				<p>THE NEW CSO</p>

				<p>REIMAGINING THE SYMPHONY'S YOUTH APPEAL</p>
			</div>
			<div class="information">
				<p>The Chicago Symphony Orchestra is a local establishment that provides Chicagoans with world-class orchestra music. The traditional audience of symphony groups rarely includes young people, and for this project, I worked with a team to understand why this is and how to design a symphony experience that attracts youth. Our solution included a sister CSO site to showcase a number of non-digital solutions aimed at humanizing the experience as well as an educational app that builds confidence in the young user in terms of classical music and the symphony experience.</p>
